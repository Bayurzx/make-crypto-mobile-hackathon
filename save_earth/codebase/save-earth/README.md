# Why I Did It (Inspiration) ???
## `For the joy of a new discovery!!!`
*What's a better way to describe the beauty of life on earth than with a simple picture?*
I wanted to create a project that could create awareness on rare, unique, endangered plants and animals. It's vital that people understand the impact we have on the natural world around us with respect to extinction of other species.

# What It Does???
- It allows any one on earth or beyond üëΩ `üòâ` To feature their discovery! And with the help of AI, The app can help detect high priority images, add it to a special collection which the admin can easily utilize.
- It also creates a community for we, the environmental/nature freaks, NGOs, scientists, researchers, explorers, adventurers of the world who care about nature...  etc... To come together and feature, discuss something weird you saw from some where on earth and save it. Hence, Save-Earth get it... üòÅüòäüòìüòì
- The app, with the help of the Custom Vision Prediction API was able to detect and then classify images returning a probability percent and give responses based on the probability.
- Reward users with CELO tokens when a prioritized discovery is found

- The app was able to automatically store high priority images that were detected by the Custom Vision AI by creating and saving it into Blob Containers.

- It also allowed people, given admin access, to tag and send image datasets for training.

# What Do You Do???
## Checkout the site here üëâ [SaveearthAI](https://saveearth.xyz/) üëà
---
- First, signin with google.
- Upload link shows only show after signin
- Give it a name, add a caption, give some description, tell us where you saw it. Take a pic and upload it or send us the link. Upload it to AI ü§ñ to see if it's on our radar. Then add a location. Have in mind that the app uses `Google Geocoder API` So use a language Google map will understand. It also uses `Google Javascript Map API` for exact coordinates so don't forget to click the coordinate button!.
- You will need to access to your celo wallet to donate or recieve rewards!

# How we built it???
Save_Earth_AI Architecture üëá

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bayurzx/Save_Earth_AI/master/screenshots/saveearth%20architecture1.png)
- A user fills the form at the upload page, includes an image but first, sends the image data to Custom Vision AI
- If the image is detected by AI, If it is prioritized, it is sent to a blob container.
  - Prioritized images have at least +99.5% accuracy allowance.
  - The `CELO reward` is then released
- User receives response and can continue with uploading data
- The data is then stored in the database (Blobs go the Blob container; documents go to NoSQL)
---
- Similar step involves creation of Image Datasets.
- Anyone can create dataset (provided they have admin access) but only Root Administrator can train the customvision AI.
- This was put to in place to prevent common mistakes like:
    - Using bad data
    - Overfitting the model
    - Using unbalanced data

# What's Next???
- It was so much fun implementing CELO contracts to this project. 
- The vision ahead is to allow creation of `NFTs` for user discoveries
  - While the world slowly transitions in to `web3` cloud providers cloud providers are relied on for blob storage.
  - In the future images will be added to the IPFS network instead

---

## Stack Highlights ü•™ü•™ü•™
- [ContractKit](https://docs.celo.org/developer-guide/contractkit) elps you to communicate with your contract.
- The celo contract was built on the [Alfajores Testnet](https://docs.celo.org/getting-started/alfajores-testnet)
- [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) was used mainly for writing the solidity contract
- Azure Cognitive Services' **Custom Vision** : Custom Vision makes it easy for anyone to train and analyze tagged `Image Datasets` without much prior experience with an already provided machine learning algorithm without, the complexity of spinning up VMs or GPU clusters. 
- Azure Container Storage: This enables storing blob files such as images for backups, archiving, retrieval and analysis

### This web app also made use of :
| Languages  | Frameworks | Cloud services | Databases        | APIs        | Platform    |
 | ---------- | ---------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| JS, HTML,CSS | Reactjs  | Azure(VM, VNet etc.) | DataStax Astra(Frontend)     | Azure BlobClient API, Azure Custom Vision API, Google Geocoder API, Google JavaScript Map API   |  Netlify   |

## Here are examples of trained images the AI will detect
Alpaca, American Crow, American Goldfinch (Male), American Robin (Adult), American Robin (Juvenile), Blue Jay, Common Grackle, `Hedgehog` House Wren, Mourning Dove, Northern Cardinal (Adult Male),  `Parrot`, `Red Panda`, Red-tailed Hawk (Dark morph), `Sunflower`, Tufted Titmouse, `White Tiger`.

### So Feel free to use the any of these and check the AI response (*Surprise, surpriseüòâ*)

## Setting UP!.

### Setting up CELO
- Install the CeloExtensionWallet from the google chrome store.
  - Or, connect to the celo network on Metamask, Yes it is metamask accessible. For more info: [Metamask on Celo Network](https://medium.com/defi-for-the-people/how-to-set-up-metamask-with-celo-912d698fcafe)
- For new users, reate a wallet 
- Go to https://celo.org/developers/faucet and get tokens for the alfajores testnet.
- Switch to the alfajores testnet in the CeloExtensionWallet.

# Final Setup

Clone to your local machine...
`git clone <put copied git link here>`

Install all dependencies in package.json
`npm install`

While that is working, you should sort out your .env file, go to the .env.sample file you will get details on your environment variables

You should run using `npx netlify dev` to enable you utilize netlify-cli functions

Happy coding!

Transcripts

Unlike the previous  five mass extinction events, the current extinction challenge is one in which a single species - humans! - appears to be almost wholly responsible. This is referred to as the sixth extinction crisis in the scientific community.

The app helps to create a community for the environmentalist, "nature freaks", N.G.Os, scientists, researchers, explorers, adventurers of the world who care about nature... To come together and feature, discuss something weird, you saw from some where on earth and save for all to see.

The best part is... When You! make prioritized discoveries, you get rewarded CELOO Tokens for being a contributor to the community. Celo is a global payments tools accessible to anyone with a mobile phone.

Let's get started!... Here is the most important page, The upload page. You add details, such as name... caption, description... To add an image, you can choose to add, an image link, or the actual file.

When you click the, send to AI button, your image is sent to an image classifying, machine-learning algorithm. If the, prediction probability is above a threshold, you get rewarded Celooo tokens. 

As shown on the, architecture diagram, after you've been rewarded... priority images are sent to their own special containers while others below threshold are sent to a general container.

Every container is logically isolated. ...People with Admin access, can create image dataset, for training, through the A.I. training API. The root admin, can then decide on dataset for training

You can learn more about, the discovery at its detail page, you get to see details such as it's pin-point location... add comments, and make celo tokens donations.

What's next?... In the future, we plan to integrate with N.F.Tees. What's even better than a rare or near-extinct discovery? A digitally rare and unique collectible, Owned by the discoverer!

Sooo..., Let's save the wonders of Earth one picture at a time..., Thank you for this opportunity, we had a lot of fun, while learning, from the celo community, at the celo mobile hackathon
